Ailusion:Synthetic Image Generation, Preprocessing, and Flux Model Forward Pass
Synthetic Image Generation, Preprocessing, and Minimal Flux ModelOverviewThis project consists of three main components:
**Overview:** 
This project consists of three main components:
Synthetic Image Generation - Uses Stable Diffusion to generate synthetic images from a text prompt.
Image Preprocessing - Processes generated images by resizing, normalizing, and optionally converting them to grayscale.
Minimal Flux Model: Forward Pass Demonstration - Uses Flux (Julia’s ML library) to perform a forward pass on a preprocessed image using a simple neural network model.
**Features**:
Generate synthetic images using Stable Diffusion.
Preprocess images for model input (resize, normalize, grayscale conversion optional).
Implement a minimal neural network in Flux and run a forward pass on preprocessed images.

**Installation**:
Python DependenciesEnsure you have Python installed and install the required libraries:
-  pip install diffusers transformers torch torchvision pillow opencv-python numpy

**Julia Dependencies** Ensure you have Julia installed and install required packages:
- using Pkg
Pkg.add(["Flux", "Images", "FileIO"])



**How the Images are Generated and Processed**
**Generating the Images**
The program uses AI (Stable Diffusion model) to create images based on text descriptions (prompts).
You provide a description (for example, "a magical forest with glowing trees"), and the AI generates an image that matches this description.
At least three different images are generated based on different prompts.
The generated images are saved to your computer with clear filenames, such as image_1.png, image_2.png, etc.
Preprocessing the Images

After generation, the images are processed to prepare them for machine learning models.
Each image is resized to a fixed size (224×224 pixels) to maintain consistency.
The pixel values are normalized, meaning they are converted to a range between 0 and 1. This helps the AI model process them efficiently.
(Optional) The images can be converted to grayscale to simplify the input and reduce complexity.
Saving and Using the Processed Images

The processed images are saved separately so they can be used for further analysis.
These images can then be fed into a neural network model for tasks like classification, object recognition, or other AI-based analysis.
